Over our first season and beyond, the series will follow its cast of remarkable characters from London to Arizona, Nigeria to Moldova, as the Power evolves from a tingle in teenagers' collarbones to a complete reversal of the power balance of the world. Everything's about to change, for everyone.</p>",
